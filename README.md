## <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

Agent Skill Sharing is a fullstack platform for discovering and sharing AI Agent capabilities, built on the TanStack Start framework. The application utilizes TailwindCSS for responsive UIs and TypeScript for end-to-end type safety across complex nested routes. It integrates Clerk for authentication, Firebase for real-time data and community upvotes, and custom Middlewares for request validation. Product analytics are handled by PostHog, while CodeRabbit automates senior-level code reviews to maintain a professional codebase.
